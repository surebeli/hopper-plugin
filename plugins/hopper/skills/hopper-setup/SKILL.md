description: "Use when the user wants a Hopper vendor readiness check or doctor — which vendor CLIs are installed and authenticated, which support sandbox control or web search, cached/known models, and (with --deep) live model-catalog drift. Triggers: 'hopper setup', 'hopper doctor', 'are my vendors ready', 'check vendor health', 'which vendors can I dispatch to'."

# Hopper Setup / Doctor

Report per-vendor readiness before dispatching: installed? · authenticated? · sandbox control · web-search · models · capability freshness. This is the consolidated `--setup` / `--doctor` diagnostic — a read-only registry+filesystem check that does NOT need a `.hopper/` project directory, so it runs from anywhere.

## Steps

1. Locate `hopper-dispatch` from `PATH` or the plugin root near this `SKILL.md` (no `.hopper/` project lookup is required — `--setup` computes from the static adapter registry plus per-vendor install/auth checks).
2. Run the readiness report:
   - All vendors: `hopper-dispatch --setup` (alias: `hopper-dispatch --doctor`).
   - One vendor: `hopper-dispatch --setup <vendor>`.
   - Deep diagnostics: add `--deep` to also check flag/parameter drift (`<vendor> --help` vs the flags the adapter emits) AND reconcile each vendor's live-enumerated model catalog against the hardcoded `knownGood` defaults. `--deep` spawns `<vendor> --help` and the model-enumeration probe once per vendor and refreshes the probe cache.
3. Surface the table. Guidance for routing the next task:
   - Confirm Installed=yes + Auth=ok before routing to a vendor.
   - Research / PRD / market tasks that need the web → a vendor with WebSrch=yes.
   - Review / read-only tasks → prefer Sandbox=argv (read-only is actually enforced via flags), not native.
   - Under `--deep`, a `DRIFT` model row is advisory (the live bundled list can differ from what an account can actually use); `driftExpected` names are suppressed so DRIFT only fires on a genuinely new model.

## Safety

- Read-only. Do NOT auto-install or auto-authenticate any vendor. If one is missing or unauthed, point the user at `hopper-smoke` and the install matrix; surface the auth notes rather than acting.
- `--deep` is opt-in and single-attempt per vendor (distinct from the dispatch single-spawn invariant); it is the only mode that spawns subprocesses here.
- The authoritative model/effort/sandbox matrix is `hopper-dispatch --rules`; `--setup` is the readiness layer on top.
