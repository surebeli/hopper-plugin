# Hopper Dashboard

A local, read-mostly web dashboard for visualizing the `hopper-plugin` agent
dispatch lifecycle: task queue, vendor inventory, live log streams, and cost
totals. Built as a sidequest; ships as a real product. Binds `127.0.0.1` only.

> Architectural background and full design contract: [`docs/sidequests/web-dashboard/SPEC.md`](../docs/sidequests/web-dashboard/SPEC.md)
> Build retrospective: [`docs/sidequests/web-dashboard/SIDEQUEST-COMPLETE.md`](../docs/sidequests/web-dashboard/SIDEQUEST-COMPLETE.md)

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dashboard:build
npm run dashboard:start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7777` in a browser. The dashboard reads from the
project's `.hopper/` directory and reflects live state via Server-Sent Events.

For development with HMR:

```bash
npm run dashboard:dev
```

Dev mode runs Vite (HMR) on `127.0.0.1:5173` with a proxy to the API server
on `127.0.0.1:7777`. Open the Vite URL for the live-editing experience.

---

## Routes

The dashboard has four routes, navigable via the top-right nav or keyboard
shortcuts (see below).

### `/` — Queue View

Renders `.hopper/queue.md` as a sortable, filterable table grouped by status.
Updates in real time via the `/events/queue` SSE channel when the file changes.

- 5 columns: ID, Type, Status, Vendor, Brief
- 5 status states with color + glyph dual encoding: `pending` (gray circle),
  `in-progress` (mint filled), `done` (mint outline), `failed` (coral X),
  `removed` (gray with strikethrough)
- Click a row to open the task detail drawer
- Search input (top-right) filters by ID or brief substring; press `/` to
  focus from anywhere

### `/task/:id` — Task Detail Drawer

Opens as a right-side drawer (760px wide, no overlay — queue stays visible
behind). Reads `.hopper/handoffs/<task-id>-output.md`.

- **Frontmatter tab**: parsed YAML key-value table; missing fields show `—`
- **Output tab**: markdown body rendered (tables, lists, code blocks with
  line numbers, ANSI-colored quotes)
- **Progress tab**: recent progress JSONL events with pinned terminal event
- **Live log tab**: SSE-streamed tail of `<task-id>-output.log` with ANSI
  color preservation, append-only DOM (10000-line ring buffer), and
  auto-follow with manual scroll-lock

Direct-link URLs work: `http://127.0.0.1:7777/task/T-WEB-04` opens the drawer
on page load. Press `Esc` to close (URL returns to `/`).

### `/vendors` — Vendor Inventory

5-card grid showing each vendor adapter's state:

- `codex`, `kimi`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `agy`
- Install status, cached models, staleness marker (`[STALE]` matches
  `hopper-dispatch --models <vendor>` CLI output)
- "Probe" button on each card — see _Probe action_ below

### `/cost` — Cost Log View

Renders `.hopper/COST-LOG.md` as:

- Three stat cards: row count, total tokens, approximate total $
- Cost-by-vendor horizontal bars (pure CSS — no chart library)
- Detail table of all entries with date / task / vendor / tokens / $ / notes

Vendor cells in the detail table show full model name on hover (e.g.,
`codex` cell tooltips `codex-gpt-5.5`).

---

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | Move queue row selection down / up |
| `Enter` | Open selected task drawer |
| `Esc` | Close task drawer (returns to `/`) |
| `/` | Focus queue search input (navigates to `/` first if elsewhere) |
| `g q` | Go to Queue (`/`) |
| `g v` | Go to Vendors (`/vendors`) |
| `g c` | Go to Cost (`/cost`) |

The `g`-chord has a 1.5-second timeout; press `g` then the destination key
within that window.

Shortcuts are disabled when typing in inputs, textareas, selects, or
`contenteditable` regions.

---

## Probe action (the only write surface)

The "Probe" button on each vendor card triggers
`hopper-dispatch --probe <vendor>` via a confirmation dialog. This is the
**only** mutation the dashboard makes — it refreshes the per-vendor
capability cache (`cli/src/cache.js`).

Safety:

- Vendor name allowlist (`codex` / `kimi` / `opencode` / `copilot` / `agy`)
  enforced server-side; command injection via vendor name is impossible
- Only `--probe <vendor>` args are ever passed to `hopper-dispatch`
- No `--background` or `--dispatch` flags are accepted; writes to
  `.hopper/queue.md` always go through ping protocol, never the dashboard
- 60-second timeout with `child.kill()` if the probe hangs
- Per-vendor concurrency lock: 409 if the same probe is already running
- On failure, a toast surfaces the error (sonner)

The probe writes only to `cli/src/cache.js`'s cache file (not under
`.hopper/`), so it never collides with concurrent ping sessions.

## Progress data consistency

Task progress uses a best-effort snapshot plus live SSE tail. Around log
rotation, `/api/task/:id/progress` may briefly under-deliver history while
`/events/progress/:id` continues from the current file. Treat snapshots as
best-effort context, not an authoritative event count.

---

## Configuration

| Flag / env | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--port <n>` | `7777` | Bind to a different port. Must be in 1-65535. |
| `--dev` | off | Run Vite + API server concurrently for HMR development. |
| `--host <ip>` | `127.0.0.1` | **Locked** to `127.0.0.1`. Any other value throws. |
| `--help` / `-h` | — | Print usage. |
| `HOPPER_DIR` (env) | auto-discover | Override `.hopper/` location. Auto-discovery walks up 8 parent levels from CWD. |

The dashboard never exposes itself on `0.0.0.0`, `::`, or `*`. This is
enforced at three layers: CLI arg parser, server config, server listen
callback.

## Architecture

```
filesystem            chokidar          SSE broker          EventSource
.hopper/*.md   ──▶   server/events  ──▶  /events/*    ──▶  useSSE hook ──▶ Query cache
                          │
                          └─ liveness tick (5s) ──▶ /events/liveness

client action  ──▶ POST /api/action/probe ──▶ spawn(hopper-dispatch --probe ...)
```

- **Backend**: Node ESM + Express + chokidar. Reads `cli/src/*.js` pure
  functions (whitelisted; see [SPEC §B.1](../docs/sidequests/web-dashboard/SPEC.md))
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Radix
  primitives (4 packages, all whitelisted)
- **Data**: 7 SSE channels (queue / task / progress / log / cost / agents / liveness)
  backed by file watchers; Tanstack Query for cache invalidation
- **Bundle**: code-split into main chunk (always loaded; 119 KB gzipped) +
  TaskDetailRoute lazy chunk (loaded on first drawer open; 65 KB gzipped)
- **Loopback-only**: hard-enforced at three layers; never opens to network

Watched files (read-only):

```
.hopper/queue.md              → /events/queue
.hopper/handoffs/*.md         → /events/task/:id
.hopper/handoffs/*-output.log → /events/log/:id
.hopper/handoffs/*-progress.log → /events/progress/:id
.hopper/COST-LOG.md           → /events/cost
.hopper/AGENTS.md             → /events/agents
(internal 5s tick)            → /events/liveness
```

## Limitations / not supported

- **Remote access** — by design. If you need to view the dashboard from
  another machine, set up an SSH tunnel; the dashboard will not change to
  accommodate this.
- **Authentication / multi-user** — none. The cost log shows token and $
  data; if anyone other than you has filesystem access to this machine,
  they can also read it directly.
- **Server-side persistence** — none. Files are the source of truth;
  closing the dashboard leaves zero residual state.
- **Queue mutation from dashboard** — not allowed. Queue writes are ping
  protocol's territory (see `.hopper/PING.md`); only `--probe` writes to
  the vendor cache.
- **`hopper-dispatch --dispatch` from dashboard** — not allowed.
- **Cross-platform** — Windows 11 is the verified baseline. macOS and
  Linux should work (no platform-specific code) but haven't been formally
  tested.

## Troubleshooting

### Build / install issues

**`npm install` shows audit warnings about Vite 5 / esbuild**: these are
moderate-severity advisories under the §B.3-mandated Vite 5 range. Vite 6+
upgrade is out of sidequest scope.

**`npm test` shows 2 failures on `commands/*.md` frontmatter**: this is
known CRLF test fragility — `git`'s default `core.autocrlf=true` on
Windows can rewrite LF to CRLF in fresh checkouts, and the test uses
strict `^---\n` matching. Workaround: `git config core.autocrlf false`
before checking out, or run tests in a worktree with that config.

### Runtime issues

**Port 7777 is already in use**: pass `--port <other>`. Default is 7777
because the CLI also defaults there.

**Dashboard shows "task output not found" for a known task**: the dashboard
reads from `.hopper/handoffs/<task-id>-output.md`; if `hopper-dispatch`
hasn't written there yet (or used a different path), the API returns 404.
This is correct — there's nothing to display.

**Live log stops updating mid-stream**: the SSE client uses exponential
backoff (500ms → 30s, max 10 attempts). After 10 failed reconnects it
shows "lost connection — reload page". Reload to recover.

**Probe button stuck in loading**: per-vendor concurrency lock. Another
probe of the same vendor is in flight; wait for it (or check server logs).
60-second hard timeout kills hung child processes.

**Cost view shows `vendor: "unknown"` rows**: parser couldn't infer the
vendor from the model column. Use `model: "codex-gpt-5.5"` style (known
prefix), `model: "claude-opus-4-7 via codex"` (explicit override), or
ensure model strings are at least 3 chars after sanitization.

### Server lifecycle

**`Ctrl+C` doesn't shut down cleanly on Windows**: the dashboard installs
SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers that close server + watcher + SSE hub in order.
Force-kill with `taskkill /F /PID <pid>` if needed.
